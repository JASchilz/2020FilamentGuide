# 2020 Filament Guide

## Printing Guidelines

The included part is small, has small tolerances, and some delicate geometries: you'll have to provide sufficient cooling between layers.

One way to provide cooling between layers if you don't have a cooling fan is to print multiple parts, spaced well apart. I got good results printing four of these filament guides spaced well across my build area.
